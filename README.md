# Trombone

Play Campfire sounds, right in your terminal.

## Why?

We are now using Hipchat, and we really miss the Campfire sounds that we could send to each other. Since we are now mostly working in the same office, with *trombone*, we still have the chance to play our favorite sounds to our teammates using a terminal and a speakers.

## Installation

Simply run :

    $ gem install trombone

## Usage

```
trombone list
trombone play SOUND
```

## Limitation

Currently, *trombone* only works on Mac OS X, since it uses the `afplay` command line tool.

Pull requests welcome to support more platforms!
